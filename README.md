#About
We want to make loyalty program simple, secure and has the best user experience. Dóro network built on top of ethereum blockchain to help small businesses awarding customers with crypto token on a global scale. Doro Network has a dual token structure that combines the governance token DGOV and the LOYALTY CRYPTO TOKEN DORO.

What is DGOV token?
DGOV Token is an ERC-20 asset that empowers community governance of the Doro Network, token-holders and their delegates debate, propose, and vote on all changes to the network. DGOV is capped at 100 Millions Tokens.

How does the DGOV token distribution work?
DGOV token is distributed through Check-in Mining and Liquidity Mining.

How Check-in Mining works?
The initial “CHECK IN” mining program will go live Nov,3rd,2020 12:00am UTC. This program distributes DGOV tokens to those who call the mining contract check-in function.The mining contract check in function initiates the mining process of the DGOV token. Each wallet address is restricted to call the check in function once every 10 minutes. The number of times one checks in, multiplied by the “time collapsed” (the interval between the call of the check in function and when the token is claimed) will determine the number of DGOV token you receive. However once you claimed your DGOV token, your check in records will be reset. The DGOV pool in the CHECK IN mining program unlocks gradually over time, and CHECK IN miner receive tokens over the unlocked DOGV over time. 15,000,000 DGOV will be allocated to CHECK IN mining pools which roughly translates to: 8640 DGOV per pool per day.
